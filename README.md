-    Tomatoes, which have a very important place in the economy of our country, constitute one of the important income sources of our farmers in the regions where they are grown. Late detection and spread of diseases in tomatoes greatly affect the quality and quantity of production. In order to counteract the problem, early diagnosis of diseases using a fast reliable non-destructive method will benefit the farmers. Because cultivating tomatoes is as sensitive as a simple task, the plant can catch the disease as a result of the wrong intervention of the person (a farmer, owner of a greenhouse, or someone who grows tomatoes in her backyard). 

-    In this study, images of tomato leaves (9 diseases and a healthy class) obtained from tomato dataset is provided as input to machine learning-based architectures to find solutions to these problems. The role of the number of images and significance of hyperparameters (namely minibatch size, weight, and bias learning rate) in the classification accuracy and execution time have been analyzed. The system we created is currently working only for tomatoes. However, itâ€™ll contain many important plants in the future like lettuce, pepper, eggplant, etc. We planned to provide a system that the user can take a picture of a plant and easily upload the plant's picture to the mobile application. After that, the user will receive a result about the disease of the plant, and information on how to avoid and treat it. The application will be user-friendly and finally, it will increase efficiency, save time, optimize plant production and protection, while making a contribution to sustainable agriculture.
