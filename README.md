-    Tomatoes, which have a very important place in the economy of our country, constitute one of the important income sources of our farmers in the regions where they are grown. Late detection and spread of diseases in tomatoes greatly affect the quality and quantity of production. In order to counteract the problem, early diagnosis of diseases using a fast reliable non-destructive method will benefit the farmers. Because cultivating tomatoes is as sensitive as a simple task, the plant can catch the disease as a result of the wrong intervention of the person (a farmer, owner of a greenhouse, or someone who grows tomatoes in her backyard). In this study, images of tomato leaves (9 diseases and a healthy class) obtained from tomato dataset is provided as input to machine learning-based architectures to find solutions to these problems. The role of the number of images and significance of hyperparameters (namely minibatch size, weight, and bias learning rate) in the classification accuracy and execution time have been analyzed. The system we created is currently working only for tomatoes. However, itâ€™ll contain many important plants in the future like lettuce, pepper, eggplant, etc. We planned to provide a system that the user can take a picture of a plant and easily upload the plant's picture to the mobile application. After that, the user will receive a result about the disease of the plant, and information on how to avoid and treat it. The application will be user-friendly and finally, it will increase efficiency, save time, optimize plant production and protection, while making a contribution to sustainable agriculture. When the contribution of the project to the national economy is evaluated, as a result of the realization of the project and the potential of producing solutions to the problems of the society, this application, which directs the agriculture and provides benefit to agriculture, will be a concrete example of increasing the yield and gaining time and material, by guiding the user in terms of the cultivation of the plant and applying the correct intervention. Although the application is currently at the local level in terms of its language being Turkish, foreign languages will be added to the application in the future. When the potential of educating scientists and producing new projects is evaluated for the scientific and technological research power of the country, the use of algorithms for machine learning, artificial neural networks and image processing in such a subject will contribute to those who will write a research article in the future.
